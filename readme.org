* Personal Scripts
This is a collection of scripts I use to automate some routine tasks.

** setup
These are scripts to automate setting up a fresh install of Pop!_OS.
Note that the gnome_extensions.sh in ./programs/ is not included in the overall setup script.

** undervolt.sh
Undervolts my nvidia gpu.
It also needs to be paired with a 100mhz overclock through Green With Envy.
** usb-wakeup-disabled.py
Disables the wake-from-sleep functionality of specific USB peripherals.
It needs to be run after every reboot.
